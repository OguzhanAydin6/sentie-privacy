# SENTIE — Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** February 2026

---

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to **Sentie**. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the Sentie mobile application.

---

## 2. Photos & Camera Use
Sentie uses your device’s camera and photo library only to enable the following features:
- **Aura Analysis (Auranı Keşfet)**
- **Soul Connection**

### Important:
- Photos are **processed on your device**
- Photos are **not stored permanently**
- Photos are **not uploaded to our servers**

Any image you capture or select is used only for real-time analysis and is discarded when the session ends.

---

## 3. Scan History & Local Storage
When you choose to save an analysis:
- Only **non-image data** (such as aura colors, whisper score, and analysis results) is stored
- This data is saved **locally on your device**
- You may delete this data at any time from within the app

## User-Generated Text (Not Stored)
- Some features allow you to enter personal text (for example, reflective prompts). This text is used only to generate on-screen guidance during your session. It is **not saved**, **not retained**, and **not transmitted to our servers**.

## Account and Limited Social Interaction Data
As part of optional account features and the in-app friend system, Sentie processes a limited set of account-related data on the server side. This data may include a user-defined display name, date of birth, selected core energies, the system-assigned Sentie Identification Number (ID), friend connection records, and last activity timestamps.

Light messages within the application are sent using predefined message options. No free-text message content is stored. However, in order for the system to function properly, interaction records such as which predefined message was sent, the sender and recipient identifiers, the time of delivery, and delivery status are stored on the server.

These data are used for managing friend requests, delivering light messages, enforcing daily usage limits, and operating the point and reward systems. Users may request deletion of their account data and associated social interaction records at any time through the in-app “Delete Account” option. Once the account deletion process is completed, the relevant data stored on the server are removed from the system.

## 4. Sharing
If you choose to share a result:
- Only the **text or content you explicitly choose** is shared
- Sentie does not automatically share any personal data

---

## 5. Advertising
Sentie may display optional advertisements through third-party advertising providers such as Google AdMob.

Advertisements are shown only when the user chooses to view them.

These services may automatically collect limited information, which may include:
- Device type and operating system
- IP address (for general location estimation)
- Advertising identifiers (such as IDFA on iOS or Advertising ID on Android)
- Basic interaction data related to ad performance

Sentie does not access, store, or use camera images, aura analysis results, personal reflective text, or account data for advertising purposes.

We do not sell personal data.

Users can control advertising and tracking permissions through their device settings.

## 6. Children’s Privacy
Sentie is not intended for users under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

- Access and delete your locally stored data
- Control app permissions through your device settings
- Contact us regarding any privacy concerns

## 8. Account Deletion

Users can delete their account at any time directly from within the app:

Settings → Delete Account

When an account is deleted:
- All associated personal data is permanently removed from our servers.
- The Sentie ID is deleted.
- Social interaction records linked to the account are erased.
- This action cannot be undone.

No personal data is retained after account deletion.
